    <h1>Don't be afraid to be <then a 100% sucess & >more:</h1>
    <p>

        It is not the critic who counts. ... The credit belongs to the man who is 
        actually in the arena; whose face is marred by the dust and sweat and blood;
        who strives valiantly ... who, at worst, if he fails, at least fails while
        daring greatly; so that his place shall never be with those cold and timid 
        souls who know neither victory or defeat.
